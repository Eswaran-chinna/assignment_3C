        <p > <h3 id="section2">CSS </h3>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document 
          written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
           alongside HTML and JavaScript. 
          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
          This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification 
          of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant 
          CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable 
          the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
           formatting. <br>
          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for
           different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
            and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed 
            on a mobile device. 
          
          The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than 
          one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

        <p><h3 id="section3">Bootstrap </h3>
          Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages 
          (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices
           of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in
            charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style 
            definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements 
            across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap
             to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for 
             light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

          Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components in the form of jQuery plugins. They provide additional 
          user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of
           an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the
            functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete function for 
            input fields.    
          A precompiled version of Bootstrap is available in the form of one CSS file and three JavaScript files that
           can be readily added to any project. The raw form of Bootstrap, however, enables developers to implement
            further customization and size optimizations. This raw form is modular, meaning that the developer can
            remove unneeded components, apply a theme and modify the uncompiled Sass files.

        <p><h3 id="section4">React.js </h3>
          React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library
           for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and
           a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development
            of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and 
            rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional
             libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.
          React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of 
          React called "FaxJS". He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first 
          deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012.It was open-sourced at JSConf US
           in May 2013.

          React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at
           Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.
          
          On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new set of internal algorithms for rendering,
           as opposed to React's old rendering algorithm, Stack.React Fiber was to become the foundation 
           of any future improvements and feature development of the React library. The actual syntax for
            programming with React does not change; only the way that the syntax is executed has changed.
             React's old rendering system, Stack, was developed at a time when the focus of the system on
              dynamic change was not understood. Stack was slow to draw complex animation, for example, 
              trying to accomplish all of it in one chunk. Fiber breaks down animation into segments that 
              can be spread out over multiple frames. Likewise, the structure of a page can be broken into 
              segments that may be maintained and updated separately. JavaScript functions and virtual DOM 
              objects are called "fibers", and each can be operated and updated separately, allowing for 
              smoother on-screen rendering.

        <p><h3 id="section5">MongoDb </h3>
          MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets. A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data.
           Each replica-set member may act in the role of primary or secondary replica at any time. All writes and reads
            are done on the primary replica by default. Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary 
            using built-in replication. When a primary replica fails, the replica set automatically conducts an election 
            process to determine which secondary should become the primary. Secondaries can optionally serve read 
            operations, but that data is only eventually consistent by default.

          If the replicated MongoDB deployment only has a single secondary member, a separate daemon called an arbiter 
          must be added to the set. It has a single responsibility, which is to resolve the election of the new primary.
           As a consequence, an idealized distributed MongoDB deployment requires at least three separate servers, 
          even in the case of just one primary and one secondary.

        <p>  <h3 id="section6">Node.js </h3>
          Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine 
          and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line
          ools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page
           is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,
           unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages 
           for server-side and client-side scripts.

          Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer to 
          a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven 
          architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability
           in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications 
           (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).
